## A. Previous conditions

If the provider has included a diagnosis in the final diagnostic statement; such as the discharge summary or the face sheet; it should ordinarily be coded. Some providers include in the diagnostic statement resolved conditions or diagnoses and status-post procedures from previous admissions that have no bearing on the current stay. Such conditions are not to be reported and are coded only if required by hospital policy:

However, history codes (categories Z80-Z87) may be used as secondary codes if the historical condition or family history has an impact on current care or influences treatment.

## B. Abnormal findings

Abnormal findings (laboratory; x-ray; pathologic; and other diagnostic results) are not coded and reported unless the provider indicates their clinical significance. If the findings are outside the normal range and the provider has ordered other tests to evaluate the condition or prescribed treatment; it is appropriate to ask the provider whether the abnormal finding should be added.

Please note: This differs from the coding practices in the outpatient setting for coding encounters for diagnostic tests that have been interpreted by a provider.

## C.Uncertain Diagnosis

If the diagnosis documented at the time of discharge is qualified as "probable" "suspected" "likely" "questionable""possible" or "still to be ruled out" "compatible with; "consistent with" or other similar terms indicating uncertainty; code the condition as if it existed or was established. The bases for these guidelines are the diagnostic workup, arrangements for further workup or observation; and initial therapeutic approach that correspond most closely with the established diagnosis.

Note: This guideline is applicable only to inpatient admissions to short-term, acute, long-term care and psychiatric hospitals.

## Previous Conditions

## Abnormal Findings

## Uncertain Diagnosis

- Code conditions included in the discharge summary if pertinent to current stay.
- Code history of codes if relevant to the current stay.
- Uncertain diagnoses present on inpatient discharge are coded as if they exist.
- This guideline differs from outpatient coding. See IVH.
- Code abnormal findings only if documented as clinically significant by
- the provider:
- Query the provider if ordering additional tests and there is no documentation of clinical significance.

## Section IV. Diagnostic Coding and Reporting Guidelines for Outpatient Services

These coding guidelines for outpatient diagnoses have been approved for use by hospitalsl providers in coding and reporting hospital-based outpatient services and provider-based office visits. Guidelines in Section I, Conventions; general coding guidelines and chapter-specific guidelines; should also be applied for outpatient services and office visits.

Information about the use of certain abbreviations, punctuation; symbols; and other conventions used in the ICD-10-CM Tabular List (code numbers and titles) , can be found in Section IA of these guidelines; under "Conventions Used in the Tabular List" Section I.B. contains general guidelines that apply to the entire classification. Section IC. contains chapter-specific guidelines that correspond to the chapters as are arranged in the classification: Information about the correct sequence to use in finding a code is also described in Section L they

The terms encounter and visit are often used interchangeably in describing outpatient service contacts and; therefore; appear together in these guidelines without distinguishing one from the other.

Though the conventions and general guidelines apply to all settings; coding guidelines for outpatient and provider reporting of diagnoses will vary in a number of instances from those for inpatient diagnoses; recognizing that:

The Uniform Hospital Discharge Data Set (UHDDS) definition of principal diagnosis does not apply to hospital-based outpatient services and provider based office visits.

Coding guidelines for inconclusive diagnoses (probable; suspected, rule out; etc) were developed for inpatient reporting and do not apply to outpatients

## Selection of first-listed condition

In the outpatient setting; the term first-listed diagnosis is used in lieu of principal diagnosis.

In determining the first-listed diagnosis the coding conventions of ICD-10-CM; as well as the general and disease specific guidelines take precedence over the outpatient guidelines

Diagnoses often are not established at the time of the initial encounterlvisit. It take two or more visits before the diagnosis is confirmed. may

The most critical rule involves beginning the search for the correct code assignment through the Alphabetic Index. Never begin searching initially in the Tabular List as this will lead to coding errors-

## Outpatient Surgery

When a patient presents for outpatient surgery (same day surgery) , code the reason for the surgery as the first-listed diagnosis (reason for the encounter), even if the surgery is not performed due to a contraindication.

## Observation Stay

When a patient is admitted for observation for a medical condition; assign a code for the medical condition as the first-listed diagnosis

When a patient presents for outpatient surgery and develops complications requiring admission to observation; code the reason for the surgery as the first reported diagnosis (reason for the encounter) , followed by codes for the complications as secondary diagnoses.

The appropriate code(s) from AOO.0 through T88.9,ZOO-Z99 and UOO-U85 must be reason(s) for the encounter/visit:.

## c. Accurate reporting of ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes

For accurate reporting of ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes, the documentation should describe the patients condition; using terminology which includes specific diagnoses as well as symptoms, problems; or reasons for the encounter There are ICD-1O-CM codes to describe all of these

## D. Codes that describe symptoms and signs

Codes that describe symptoms and signs; as opposed to diagnoses; are acceptable for reporting purposes when a diagnosis has not been established (confirmed) by Laboratory Findings Not Elsewhere Classified (codes ROO-R99) contain many, but not all codes for symptoms. and

## Encounters for circumstances other than a disease or injury

ICD-1O-CM provides codes to deal with encounters for circumstances other than a disease or injury. The Factors Influencing Health Status and Contact with Health Services codes (Z00-Z99) are provided to deal with occasions when circumstances other than a disease or injury are recorded as diagnosis or problems.

See Section I.C.21. Factors influencing health status and contact with health services

## Level of Detail in Coding

## ICD-10-CM codes with 3, 4, 5,6 or 7 characters

ICD-10-CM is composed of codes with 3,4, 5,6 or 7 characters. Codes with three characters are included in ICD-1O-CM as the heading of a category of codes that may be further subdivided by the use of fourth, fifth, sixth or seventh characters to provide greater specificity.

## 2. Use of full number of characters required for a code

A three-character code is to be used only if it is not further subdivided. A code is invalid if it has not been coded to the full number of characters required for

## Highest level of specificity

Code to the highest level of specificity when supported by the medical record documentation

## G. ICD-10-CM code for the diagnosis, condition; problem, or other reason for encounterlvisit

encounter/visit shown in the medical record to be chiefly responsible for the services provided. List additional codes that describe any coexisting conditions. In some cases, the first-listed diagnosis may be a symptom when a diagnosis has not been established (confirmed) by the provider:

## H Uncertain diagnosis (See Figure IV. H)

Do not code diagnoses documented as "probable" "suspected" "questionable""rule out" "compatible with" "consistent with" or "working diagnosis" or other similar terms indicating uncertainty. Rather; code the condition(s) to the highest degree of certainty
